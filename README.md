# LMC in python

i made an lmc interpreter in python because i was learning lmc assembly in school

it doesn't really work in the same way as an actual lmc, but it has the same result (i think)

i also added a random mnemonic (RND) which generates a random number from -999 to 999 and stores that value in the accumulator

the lmc i learned in school can be accessed at https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/

# how to run:

## to run a lmc program:

in the terminal, type `lmc.py {filename}`

## to format an lmc program:

in the terminal, type `lmcformatter.py {filename}`

note that this overwrites the file. if your file/program breaks that's on you :)
